            <h3>product designer - 1yr</h3>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>ProGolfMe is an app that connects golf coaches with golf players where the players can pay for in-app lessons and performance feedback.</p>
                <p>The player sends a video of their swing to a coach of their choice, then the coach can chat with the player and they can exchange footage from anywhere at anytime. Simple right..!?</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>ProGolfMe required an MVP (minimal viable product) within 3 months and wanted to be capable of generating revenue within 6 months.</p>
                <p>At this stage ProGolfMe had no branding and no screen designs, just a logo.</p>
                <p>Communicating to the user what needed to be done in the app was evidently going to be a challenge.</p>
                
            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Using their existing logo, I generated two colour palettes and logo variations. In order to test them I contacted hundreds of golfers via a popular golf forum (thesandtrap.com) and simply held a poll for logo variations and the colours used in the screens.</p>
                <p>Conversations with golf coaches revealed that they also wanted access via an app because it was easier to take and send videos.</p>
                
            <h2>Testing</h2>
                <p>Early prototypes were tested on anyone to find immediate issues,  we quickly realised a need to test on actual golfers due to the nature of terminology used e.g. handicap.</p>

                <figcaption>Usability testing</figcaption>
                <p>Visits to the local golf club to test prototypes revealed a lack of clarity and disjointed user flows.</p>
                <p>At this stage I suggested it would be beneficial to do our work at the golf club to test more frequently with a fail fast approach, this strategy was approved and consequently we gained deeper insights.</p>
                
            <h2>Design</h2>
                <img src="../img/progolfme/design%20process%202.jpeg">
                <figcaption>Branding based on quantitative feedback.</figcaption>
                <p>I developed the company branding and with it a cohesive style guide.</p>
                <img src="../img/progolfme/design%20process%201.jpeg">
                <figcaption>Pen and paper (my go to).</figcaption>
                <p>I drafted detailed wireframes to achieve a polished product ready for release.</p>
                <img src="../img/progolfme/design%20process%204.jpeg">
                <figcaption>Sketch streamlined my workflow with component symbols.</figcaption>
                <p>I developed a simple flow that was intuitive and provided a far higher success rate for all age brackets compared with the MVP.</p>
                <p>The coaches had also demanded an app experience, therefore I was able to strategically design the app to share assets and app architecture. I made the primary colour different so that it was obvious which app you were using.</p>
                <p>Cognitive load was reduced by simplifying the navigation to three categories, profile, chat and browse coaches.</p>
                <p>I covered the whole app experience from sign-up to payment.</p>
                <p>Meticulous design communication between myself and app developers in Ukraine was critical for the successful launch of the app.</p>
                
            <h2>Result</h2>
                <p>Our MVP was in the App Store on target.</p>
                <p>By 5 months we had people using the app due to its improved architecture and user flows.</p>

            <h2>Take-away</h2>
                <p>I learned how to play golf! üèå</p>
                <p>I learned that how one approaches user testing directly affects the quality of the insights obtained.</p>
                <p>If I were to do it again, I would not just copy best practices but take the time to fully understand why they work in order to apply them with more meaning.</p>
                
            <h2>Testimony</h2>
                <q>Joe was a credit to the successful development of our product. He listened to our needs and shared creative ideas and opportunities that evolved into crucial components of our app. He is a team player that understands the limitations in programming and business decisions yet always finds a work around with techniques such as user testing or product research. If you're trying to build a software product that your users love, Joe will certainly help you get there and probably save you money to boot.</q>
