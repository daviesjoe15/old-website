            <h1>Timely</h1>
            <h3>Product Design Student - 3yrs</h3>
            <p>Loughborough University holds a unique module (design week) where successful brands set a design brief with a deadline of one week.</p>
            
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>Their problem was that people order convenience food because they don't have the time to prepare meals for themselves.</p>
            <p>The companies judge our ability to apply a balanced and appropriate design process for the problem and our design communication skills.</p>
            
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <img src="../img/timely/market_research.jpg">
            <p>The kitchen ware industry boasts many task specific time saving products. Silicon is a favoured material due to its robust nature and attractive colours.</p>
            <p>I phone interviewed a chef to identify products or practices that weren‚Äôt  typically available to the public.</p>
            
            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <img src="../img/timely/User_observation.jpg">
            <figcaption>User observation</figcaption>
            <p>In order to fully empathise with the person cooking, I observed different people cooking various dishes and then also took it upon myself to cook for all my housemates.</p>
            <p>I found that an inability to effectively track cooking and preparation times for different foods resulted in wasted time.</p>
            
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <img src="../img/timely/Ideate.jpg">
            <p>Using this insight I solved the problem by introducing a set of timers that could easily be assigned to individual cooking tasks.</p>
            <p>I took advantage of the markets use of attractive colours yet applied them logical use cases. This also helps distinguish between the task and time.</p>
            <img src="../img/timely/concept.jpg">
            <figcaption>Concepts</figcaption>
            <p>The product was simple and incorporated a bought in timer component to reduce costs.</p>
            
            <h2>Result</h2>
            <img src="../img/timely/hero.jpg">
            <figcaption>Hero</figcaption>
            <p>I was awarded 3rd prize and ¬£200 for my design.</p>
            
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This was the first time I made use of user observation and it has changed my understanding of products and the way I approach design. That is why I like this project so much.</p>
